# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Action potential and contractility changes in [Na(+)](i) overloaded cardiac myocytes: a simulation study.**   
Faber GM, Rudy Y. _Biophys J_ 2000 May;78(5):2392-404
[10777735](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10777735) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce
fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular
sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using
the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1)
During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase
without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2)
The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of
I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and
reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload
slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L))
activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased
Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode
I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent
manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens
due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD
shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and
shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant
arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to
Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed
afterdepolarizations.
